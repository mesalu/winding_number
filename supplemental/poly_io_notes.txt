poly_io brain storm:

The following is a set of plausible issues I could think of with poly_io code after
a quick skim. After completing the list I went through each element and associated
a resolution state as noted in the following legend.

Resolution State Legend:
- [+]: implemented / added myself
- [x]: current implementation adequately handled.
- [ ]: not yet handled / not applicable
- [-]: will not address / seems outside scope of prompt.

Plausible bad inputs:
- Within a particular line:
    - [x] multiple delimiters creating unreadable segments
    - [+] unexpected reasonable whitespace delimiters
    - [x] non-float-characters
    - [x] Unexpected trailing whitespace (e.g. crlf instead of lf) (NOTE: works fine on my linux environment)
- With an input file:
    - [x] DNE
    - [x] unable to open for reading.
    - [+] no trailing newline prior to EOF

Plausible ill-behavior:
- Not catching all exception types that are related to input reading.
    - [x] std::stof (both exception types accounted for)
    - [x] std::getline (failure exception type caught.)
- [x] Not closing input file in some execution path

Plausible unexpected input:
- User amenities such as
    - [-] Bracket clustering points (e.g. [1, 1] [0, 1] instead of 1 1 0 1)
    - [-] comma separation
    - [-] misc unicode characters that are similar to intended characters
    - [x] different notation types
    - [+] in-line comments
